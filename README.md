Block dodge minigame python .

This games sets you (the player) as a blue rectangle with a white outline.
Falling red and green rectangles portray differnet features.

An approximately half sized red rectangle is an 'enemy' which you aim to avoid: contact/collison will result in a life lost.
An even smaller green rectangle is a 'health bar' which you may aim to collide with to gain an extra life.
*Note that you may only recover lives and do not stack above the limit (starting amount).

the player's movement is bound to left and right only, up and down (within the grey rectangle limits)
A visible Score and Lives counter are for extra information while playing.

Before all this you must choose a difficulty signifying how many enmies will be on screen at a time by the folling metric:
Easy - 5, Medium - 7, Hard - 9, Impossible - 11.
The health bar count is always a random nummber between 1 and half the enemies count.

Once you run out of lives/ die you will be presented with your score and a message.

Enjoy!
